abstract: In authentication scenarios, applications of practical speaker
  verification systems usually require a person to read a dynamic authentication
  text. Previous studies played an audio adversarial example as a digital signal
  to perform physical attacks, which would be easily rejected by audio replay
  detection modules. This work shows that by playing our crafted adversarial
  perturbation as a separate source when the adversary is speaking, the the
  practical speaker verification system will misjudge the adversary as a target
  speaker. A two-step algorithm is proposed to optimize the universal
  adversarial perturbation to be text-independent and has little effect on
  authentication text recognition. We also estimated room impulse response (RIR)
  in the algorithm which allowed the perturbation to be effective after being
  played over the air. In the physical experiment, we achieved targeted attacks
  with a success rate of 100%, while the word error rate (WER) on speech
  recognition only increased by 3.55%. And recorded audio could pass replay
  detection for the live person speaking.
