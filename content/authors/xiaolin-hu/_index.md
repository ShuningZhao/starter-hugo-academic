I got my PhD degree in Automation and Computer-Aided Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2007, under the supervision of Prof. Jun Wang. Then I became a post-doc researcher at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University working with Prof. Bo Zhang. Since 2009, I have been a faculty member of this department, working in the TSAIL group directed by Prof. Bo Zhang and Prof. Jun Zhu. My current research interests include artificial neural networks and computational neuroscience.  

I'm an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing and Cognitive Neurodynamics. Previously I was an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems. I'm a Senior Member of IEEE.
